# Best-ways-to-wash-your-car-at-home<br>
It is by far the most relaxing activity that you can perform on a lazy Sunday and easily make a habit out of it. What you drive is fine as long as you take care of it as well, whether it’s a Ford Mustang or a Toyota Prius. The plus point being you can make it out as a family activity where your wife and kids can help you out with it. After all why to spend those dollars on something you have the manpower and will to do at home and in turn enjoy it as well. So just turn on the music, get a bucket, soap and some rags and you are ready to go.<br>
<b>When?</b><br>
Wash your car out whenever you can but at least once a week on Sundays. Don’t wait for all kind of dirt and stuff to accumulate on top it and then do it. Do light dusting or throw a cloth around it whenever you can such that nothing catches hold of your car for long durations and harm its paint and metal.<br>
<b>How?</b><br>
<b>1. Avoid parking in direct sunlight:</b> This will take care of the premature drying of the car and leave big blotches of your mit that you were dabbing with soap on it.<br>
<b>2. Get the necessaries:</b> A mit, car soap, some old rag with soft texture and a garden hose pipe connected to a water outlet. Set everything near your car and make sure you have everything.<br>
<b>3. Fill the bucket half with water</b> and make sure the bucket or the water itself is not dirty otherwise it may cause scratches. Add car wash soap as per directions mentioned on the back of the bottle.<br>
<b>4. Hose off</b> any loose dirt off the car so that you may have less dirt to deal with when you things manually.<br>
<b>5. Take the mitt</b> and soak into the soap water and start going through on the car’s surface with circular motions. Do not use brush or anything really hard. Rinse out the dirty mitt in the bucket with plain water frequently.<br>
<b>6. As you move ahead</b> from one section to the next make sure your <b>car is wet</b> from all sides as this will help in preventing any dried water or soap spots to stick onto the car. <br>
<b>7. Hose off any extra dirt</b> first on the wheels and alloys. Clean and scrub these parts of the car last as these are the dirtiest and the most difficult to clean.<br>
<b>8. Rinse off the interiors</b> of the nearby tyre areas from different angles to get rid of the mud etc deposited.<br>
<b>9. Hose everything</b> once again and then pat dry with fresh towels or soft clothes.<br>
<b>10. Every now and then</b> make sure you <b>don’t forget to touch up</b> and throw a cloth about to get rid of any settling dirt.<br>
